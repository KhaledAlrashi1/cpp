# c++ programs
I created this repository to upload any C++ program I write. I'm interested in learning about this programming language. I'll explain each program clearly during the learning process so that anyone interested might also learn. You can use any of the programs in the repository.


### What is the C++ programming langauge? And why is it important?
1. It's an extension of the C programming language, and is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.
2. It's a General-purpose language, which means it can handle low-level programming tasks as well as high-level ones.
3. It's Object-oriented programming (OOP) that supports the four major tenets of OOP: Encapsulation, Data Abstraction, Polymorphism, and Inheritance. This allows complex applications to be managed through the use of objects and classes, providing a way to structure programs that could be quickly scaled and maintained.
4. It's protable; thus, code written in C++ can be run on various computer platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac, etc.) without any modifications or very minimal changes.

### Bazel will sometimes be used to build, run, and test the C++ programs 
#### what is Bazel? 
- Bazel is a build system developed by Google. It's an open-source tool that allows for the automation of building and testing of software. Many software projects involve complex build dependencies, including linked libraries, tools, and even other software packages. Bazel helps manage these dependencies and ensure reproducible builds.
- There is a great tutorial on how to use Bazel for C++ (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLLDzLWzuag)
